PROJECT TITLE: Orange Clicker
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:To make a replica game to cookie clicker but with oranges
VERSION or DATE: January 2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Click the run button and click the orange to start
AUTHORS: Max Tan
USER INSTRUCTIONS: When game starts, read the introduction page and then click the orange to start the game. Get all the achievements by clicking the orange for more oranges and buy upgrades like power clicker or idle upgrades to increase your orange production.

Reflection after making the Game:

	One of the harder final projects I have had to do but one of the most rewarding ones. The difference between this and other projects from school is that I could add or not add whatever I wanted and seeing the slow but eventual finish to making the game was the best part. There were many challenging moments during my progress and many coding difficulties that were frustrating, as some days I would be able to get through many things, but some days I would be stuck on a problem for hours on end and figure out that it was just a variable that was repeated in the code.

	The most challenging obstacles during the making of the game was the sheer amount of code in the classes. I am sure there is probably a better way of making there to be less code in the main world class but keeping track of variables, which were static and the scope of variables was confusing at times. After leaving more comments, it become less confusing. Another coding challenge was the point where I wanted to add Idle oranges per second to the game, like Cookie Clicker, where the player could sit and do nothing but still gain score. Using the SimpleTimer class was difficult at the start, but after figuring out that each upgrade required their own timer, the process became simple. A challenge that appeared at the end of the project was when I was figuring out how to transfer variables through worlds. We were shown in class how to set worlds but after going through the Greenfoot forums and some videos, I found that you had to set the variable during the world switch method, and then you had to set another variable in the other world with the syntax (type)(name) = MyWorld.(what the variable was named in the main world). But, the main part of coding was figuring out what object interacted with what, and this used more logic to think like if I clicked the main orange, what happens? The score goes up, the score in the settings goes up, total clicks go up, a falling orange drops. Every time I added a new component to the game, I needed to figure out where it would belong to. 

	The fun parts in the coding was adding the aesthetic part where I could take my time and add labels and the pictures to the spots where they were and the falling oranges were added to resemble a bit of the Elephant eating apple game, but also because in the actual Cookie Clicker game there was a falling cookie that rotated whenever the player clicked it. The Pokemon music in the background is also just for nostalgic purposes as Cookie Clicker is pretty old and generation 4 Pokemon music is memorable for a lot of people. The sounds were mostly taken from a reddit that had all the cookie clicker sounds which was convenient. But the challenge with the sounds was that I wanted them to rotate like the actual game so it wasn't just one sound playing over and over as that would be annoying after about five clicks. So that took up a whole session of Greenfoot forums and videos to figure out how to do and it was just like how the image animated in the Greenfoot tutorial, where you set "i" as the click number and set all the sounds to click1, click2 etc. And then I would mod "i" whenever the value was at the number of click sounds I had stored.

	Overall, this game was a great experience for me as a first big project of coding and I am proud of what I made. Granted, there were things I didn't add, like golden cookies that dropped every couple minutes and special upgrades but the main idea of the game was there, clicking an orange and buying upgrades to get more oranges. There were challenges but overcoming them was a great feeling and this definitely helped influence me to take computer science next year!
